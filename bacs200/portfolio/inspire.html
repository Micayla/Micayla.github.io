       A hero is someone who, in one way or another, has touched your life in a very special way. 
       Heroes help shape the people that we become and teach us how to navigate life.

        The characteristics I most admire about Mother Teresa are as follows.
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Beautifully Humble - she never forgot WHOSE she was and from whom her gifts came </li>
        <li>Selfless - she captivated the essence of servanthood that Jesus teaches us</li>
        <li>Authentically Joyful - her joy was never shallow and based on worldy prizes</li>
        
    </ul>
    <p>
        In my life, I strive to live the sort of simple, real, faith-based life that Mother Teresa
        has shown us all. The way she expended her gifts and talents for the Lord and His good deeds, 
        put others before herself, and beamed with joy while doing it all, is admirable. You can click
