    <h2 class="display-4 text-center text-secondary bg-link p-4">Social Implications</h2>
        
    <p class="text-center">Social justice inequality has put one of the biggest divides between American people. The upcoming Presidential Election hasn't helped diffuse the situation at all either. As the fight for racial equality has gathered steam, we the people seem to have been put in a place to be forced to pick a side. As one side battles inequalities that their race have battled for so many years, the other side refuses to listen. We've come to a place as society where we would rather spread hate and dehumanize our brothers and sisters then even lend an ear just to listen and understand.

    <h2 class="display-4 text-center text-secondary bg-link p-4">Economic Implications</h2>
   
    <p class="text-left">The effects of the battle for equality have had far-reaching impacts. Some specific examples include the shift to support black-owned businesses, as well as the vandalizing of store fronts and and store property. On top of the fact that the economy has already taken a major hit from the COVID-19 virus, as Americans become less and less willing to work with and for eacgh other, we will see changes in the economy as well as a change in the distribution of wealth.</p>
    
    <h2 class="display-4 text-center text-secondary bg-link p-4">Political Implications</h2>
    
    <p class="text-left"> With the Presidential Election right around the corner, there is no doubt the implications the fight for equality has on our politics. With a president currently in office, that it seem by many as "racist" and "crude," it can feel like the American people are making a choice to support peole of color or to look the other way. Though it seems the case, the American people have major influential decisions to make when casting their vote, a moral responsibility to be a part of the direction they want to se eour country go. It's now or never!

    <h2 class="display-4 text-center text-secondary bg-link p-4">My Thoughts</h2>
    <p class="text-left">All things considered, each of us are at our different spaces in our hearts. After all, that's what I believe this is really about. Whatever your stance may be, there is no denying that America wouldn't be in a better place if we all took a look in the mirror and took the time to do some real soul searching. There's good and bad of ever side, right and wrong, but we all have a duty to leave this society and this world better than we left. Are you doing your part?! One of the simplest first steps you can take... VOTE! Thanks for reading and tuning in! </p>
